# Chaayos-Spot
 Controls spotify playback (play/pause, mute /unmute) using gestures which are read by ultrasonic sensor monitored 
 by an ESP8266
## How it works??
The Chaayos cup (ESP8266) processes the sensor reading and sends it to the flask server.
The flask server uses the Spotipy library to control the spotify music
